## Draw attention to the important parts of your website
### Example
![Example](example.png)
**\* react-see-through is used here to create the black mask above everything except the tutorial [(source)](https://calsynk.com)**

### How is this different from a Modal?
The black mask appears around existing elements on the page.

## Installation
`npm install --save react-see-through`

or

`yarn add react-see-through`

## Importing
To use the react-see-through component, you want to do:

`import { SeeThrough } from 'react-see-through';`

after installing.

## Use Cases
* Slack, Discord, and many other popular services use this type of effect for tutorials
  * This lets them direct users' attention to particular elements being introduced.

## Future Plans
* See-through multiple elements at once
* Add an easy way to place things above the mask
* Allow interacting (click, hover, etc...) with the unmasked area
  * Make only certain areas interactable?
* Typescript definitions
* Fade-out animation
* Option to add padding
* Support lone text-nodes
